[INST]You are an AI coding assistant that can write unique, diverse, and intuitive unit tests for functions given the signature and docstring.
The input of every unit tests must be different.The integers in inputs must be between -1000 and 1000.The floats in input should come as decimals.
The test must  be between [TESTS] and [/TESTS] tags.

func signature:
def add3Numbers(x, y, z):
    """ Add three numbers together.
    This function takes three numbers as input and returns the sum of the three numbers.
    """
[/INST]
[TESTS]
assert add3Numbers(1, 2, 3) == 6
assert add3Numbers(-1, 2, 3) == 4
assert add3Numbers(1, -2, 3) == 2
assert add3Numbers(1, 2, -3) == 0
assert add3Numbers(-3, -2, -1) == -6
assert add3Numbers(0, 0, 0) == 0

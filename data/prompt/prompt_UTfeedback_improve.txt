You are a helpful programming assistant and an expert Python programmer. You are helping a user write a program to solve a task. The user has written some code, but it has some errors and is not passing the tests.
You will help the user by first giving a concise ( at most 2 -3 sentences ) textual explanation of what is wrong with the code. After you have pointed out what is wrong with the code, you will then generate a fixed version of the program.
### Task Start ###
# These are the assertions for your function:
assert big_nnum([10,7,40,20,50],3) == [20, 40, 50]

# Complete the Python funtion:
def big_nnum(lst,n):
    """
    Write a function to get the n biggest items from a list.
    """

### Incorrect Python Code ###
```python
def big_nnum(lst,n):
    lst = sorted(lst)
    lst = lst[:n]
    return lst
```
Feedback: With the above function, big_nnum([10,7,40,20,50],3) == [7, 10, 20]. The assertion is "assert big_nnum([10,7,40,20,50],3) == [20, 40, 50]".The code does not pass the assertion.
So the code above is wrong.

### a concise explanation of the issue ###
The problem description states that the function should return the biggest n items in a list.
However, the code above returns the smallest n items in a list. This can be fixed by reversing the list when sort it.

def find_char_long(text):

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:
"def find_char_long(text):": This line defines a function named "
find_char_long" that takes a single argument, "text". "text" represents the
string whose words are to be extracted.
"return (re.findall(r"\b\w{4,}\b", text))": This line uses the "re.findall()
" function to extract all words from the input string that are at least 4
characters long. The regular expression "r"\b\w{4,}\b"" matches all words
that are at least 4 characters long. The "\b" matches the boundary between a
word character and a non-word character. The "\w" matches any word
character (a letter, digit, or underscore). The "{4,}" matches the preceding
element at least 4 times. The "\b" matches the boundary between a word
character and a non-word character.

        return 3
    return count_ways(n-1) + count_ways(n-2)

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:
"def count_ways(n):": This line defines a function named "count_ways" that
takes a single argument, "n". "n" represents the width of the 3 x n board.
"if n == 0:": This line checks if n is equal to 0. In other words, it checks
if the width of the board is 0. If the width of the board is 0, there is
only one way to fill it: by not placing any dominoes.
"return 1": If the condition in line 2 is true (i.e., n is 0), the function
returns 1, indicating that there is only one way to fill the 3 x 0 board.
"if n == 1:": This line checks if n is equal to 1. In other words, it checks
if the width of the board is 1. A 3 x 1 board cannot be filled with 2 x 1
dominoes, so thereâ€™s only one way to fill it: by not placing any dominoes.
"return 1": If the condition in line 4 is true (i.e., n is 1), the function
returns 1, indicating that there is only one way to fill the 3 x 1 board.
"if n == 2:": This line checks if n is equal to 2. In other words, it checks
if the width of the board is 2. A 3 x 2 board can be filled with 2 x 1
dominoes in three ways: (1) three horizontal dominoes, (2) one vertical
domino and two horizontal dominoes, and (3) two vertical dominoes and one
horizontal domino.
"return 3": If the condition in line 6 is true (i.e., n is 2), the function
returns 3, indicating that there are three ways to fill the 3 x 2 board.
"return count_ways(n-1) + count_ways(n-2)": If none of the conditions in
lines 2, 4, and 6 are true, this line is executed. It uses a recursive
approach to calculate the number of ways to fill the 3 x n board. The
function calls itself twice: once with the argument n-1 and once with the
argument n-2. The results of these two function calls are added together and
returned as the final result.
